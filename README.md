## OptQuick - Application for selling.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The application was created for the sale of goods, as well as the ability to post your own goods for sale.
The main language of the application is JavaScript using React technology.
Firebase is used as a database for storing information and pictures.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start` - for start app.

### `npm test` - for tests.

### `npm run build` - for building application.

You need to change database connection `(firebase-connect.js)` data if you use my code.
